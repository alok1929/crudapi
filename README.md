### A simple crud api created using node, express. 
## I have used postman to check for the apis. 

The public folder contains the html part. The whole tutorial contains mongodb tutorial as well. I have not written the html part. The html part was there when I cloned this git repo from the instructor.

I have written the controllers folder, routers folder, and the app.js file.
